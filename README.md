# Flmngr module for ExpressJS

> Server-side part of the Flmngr file manager for Node Express server

[![Flmngr file manager screenshot](https://flmngr.com/img/browsing.jpg)](https://flmngr.com)

[Flmngr file manager](https://flmngr.com) is used to upload and manage files and images. Can be a standalone file manager (React/Angular/etc. or custom JavaScript or TypeScript integrations) or work together with [TinyMCE](https://flmngr.com/doc/install-tinymce-plugin), [CKEditor&nbsp;4](https://flmngr.com/doc/install-ckeditor-plugin), [CKEditor&nbsp;5](https://flmngr.com/doc/install-ckeditor-5-plugin), [N1ED](https://n1ed.com), or any other JS components.

This package is a server-side implementation needed to support requests from the file manager dialog when using Node on the server. It will handle some single URL and let the file manager receive file lists and send file commands to the server.

## Install
Install the [Flmngr NPM package](https://npmjs.com/package/@flmngr/flmngr-server-node-express) using the console command in the project folder:

```
npm require flmngr/flmngr-server-node-express
```

Then follow the [integration manual](https://flmngr.com/doc/install-file-manager-server-node-express) to link Flmngr module with Express routes.
